# Lung Cancer Risk in 25-countries

This dataset contains information on lung cancer risk factors across various countries, focusing on demographic details, smoking behaviors, and family history.
## Project Overview

This project utilizes the Lung Cancer Risk in 25 Countries dataset from Kaggle, applying data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization techniques to analyze how risk factors, demographics, and regional variations influence lung cancer diagnosis and patient mortality.
## Purpose of analysis

- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Analyze how smoking habits, exposure to secondhand smoke, and family history correlate with lung cancer risk.  
- **Demographic Insights**: Explore how age and gender impact the prevalence of lung cancer risk factors.
- **Regional variatons**: Compare lung cancer risk factors across different countries and regions.    
- **Public Health Research**: Identify populations with high-risk behaviors and suggest interventions or preventive measures.

## Import Packages of Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle’s Lung-cancer-risk-in-25-countries dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aizahzeeshan/lung-cancer-risk-in-25-countries/data![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5898967e-162e-48fc-a34e-b63b50b1bea1)).

## Data cleaning and preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: The dataset was scanned for missing values, no need for imputing missing values except for 'Cancer Stage' and 'Treatment type' nan were filled with 'No info'
- **Checking for duplicates**: The dataset was scanned for fully and partially duplicated rows using data exploration techniques. This included checking for duplicates on Index (ID) columns to prevent repeating patient information
- **Cleaning columns**: Medical datasets often include categorical columns with binary values such as "Yes"/"No" responses, which are not directly suitable for numerical analysis or machine learning model, these columns were converted to numerical format of 0/1
- **Incorrect data entry**: Some records indicated that the number of years a patient had smoked exceeded their reported age — a clear indication of incorrect data entry. By addressing these issues early in the pipeline, we notice it when analyzing the dataset

## Feature engineering

Key features for this analysis include:

- **Lung_Cancer_Death_rate_in_population** : Create new column of annual lung cancer deaths by population size
- **Smoker type (`smoker-type`)**: Classifies smokers based on years of smoking and the amount of cigarretes per day:
  - **Longterm and Heavy Smoker**: Years of smoking above mean of years of smoking and the amount of cigarretes per day above mean of cigarretes per day
  - **Longterm Smoker**: Only years of smoking above mean of years of smoking 
  - **Heavy Smoker**: Only amount of cigarretes per day above mean of cigarretes per day
  - **Light Smoker**: Years of smoking below mean of years of smoking and the amount of cigarretes per day below mean of cigarretes per day

## Exploratory data analysis/visualization

1. **Lung Cancer Diagnosis & Correlations of numeric value**
2. **Lung cancer diagnosis breakdown by gender/ smoker/ smoker types**
3. **Lung Cancer Diagnosis by Family History, passive smoker, adenocarcinoma type**
4. **Lung cancer patients categorised by smoker type for each air pollution exposure split on genders**
5. **Regional Variations in Lung cancer diagnosis**:
   - Lung cancer death rate in population of each country
   - Lung cancer prevalence rate against Developed or Developing Country
   - Pairplot country numeric columns in dataset
   - Mortality rate vs. Lung cancer death rate in population by Country
   - Average mortality rate by countries
   - Top countries of Average mortality rate
   - Lung cancer cases in Ethiopia
   - Lung cancer cases in Nigeria    

## Results
- **Smoking behavior**:
    - There is positive correlation between smokers with the number of lung cancer diagnosis cases, especially of male heavy and long-term smokers
    - There are less adenocarcinoma cases of people who are smokers
    - There is no correlation between family history or passive smoking with the number of lung cancer diagnosis cases
- **Demographics**:
    - There are more male than female of positive lung cancer diagnosis cases, especially cases with smoking habits 
- **Regional variations**:
    - Developed countries show a higher rate of annual lung cancer deaths relative to their population size
    - Developing countries report a higher number of cases alongside increasing lung cancer prevalence
    - Among all countries, Ethiopia and Nigeria stand out with the highest lung cancer mortality and prevalence rates, respectively. However, the relationship between lung prevalence rate/ survival years and years of smoking varies by adenocarcinoma types or cancer stages is different by each country
