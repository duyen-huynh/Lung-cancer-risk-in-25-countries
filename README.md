# Lung-cancer-risk-in-25-countries

This dataset contains information on lung cancer risk factors across various countries, focusing on demographic details, smoking behaviors, and family history.
## Project Overview

This project utilizes the Lung Cancer Risk in 25 Countries dataset from Kaggle, applying data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization techniques to analyze how risk factors, demographics, and regional variations influence lung cancer diagnosis and patient mortality.
## Purpose of analysis

- **Risk Factor Analysis**: Analyze how smoking habits, exposure to secondhand smoke, and family history correlate with lung cancer risk.  
- **Demographic Insights**: Explore how age and gender impact the prevalence of lung cancer risk factors.
- **Regional variatons**: Compare lung cancer risk factors across different countries and regions.    
- **Public Health Research**: Identify populations with high-risk behaviors and suggest interventions or preventive measures.
